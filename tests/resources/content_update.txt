== Vocation Balancing Changes ==
=== Damage Formula Changes ===
* The damage dealt with melee and distance weapons was generally raised.
* In general, experience level has less of a influence on damage.
* Damage dealt with weapons will be more influenced by skill level.
* Damage dealt by spells will be more influenced by magic level.
** This results in a reduction of the damage dealt by knights and paladins using runes.
* To make up for the damage reduction of spells for knights and paladins, new spells were created, with damage based on their respective skills and weapons.

=== Weapon Requirements ===
This update added level and vocation requirements to wield weapons '''properly'''. When a weapon is not wielded properly, the damage dealt is reduced by half.<br/>
Only [[knight]]s are able to use two-handed weapons, with the exception of staves and poleaxes.

This change was necessary since most of the damage depends from skills now, so this would prevent a player fresh out of [[Rookgaard]] to deal great damage using a high attack weapon.

=== New ammunition ===
There was new ammunition for paladins too. They are now sold in shops or made with new spells.

== New Ice Islands ==
*[[Grimlund]] (with the Chakoya settlement [[Inukaya]])
*[[Helheim]]
*[[Hrodmir]] (with the settlement [[Svargrond]] and the barbarian camps [[Ragnir]], [[Bittermor]] and [[Grimhorn]])
*[[Nibelor]]
*[[Okolnir]]
*[[Tyrsung]] (with the mountain [[Jotunar]] and the hidden [[Frozen Trench]])
