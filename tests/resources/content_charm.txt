| notes         = The chance of this charm being triggered is 10% per attack done. Since the elemental damage charms are applied on top of the creature's elemental resistances, the Curse charm is recommended for [[Death Damage/Weak|creatures that are weak to Death Damage]]. As with the other elemental damage charms, it's most efficient when used on creatures that have a high amount of hitpoints.

Elemental damage Charms are the best ones available for [[Druid]]s and [[Sorcerer]]s and should be the first one unlocked by these vocations. They are also very good for [[Paladin]]s depending on the hunt and creatures. Even though [[Knight]]s will usually give preference to Defensive Charms, at some point the Knight may wish to switch to offensive charms to maximize its damage output.

The choice between the 6 elemental damage charms depends mostly on the creatures the player has unlocked in the bestiary and the creatures usually hunted. Since not many creatures are weak to [[Death Damage]] and those who are usually have some other elemental weakness, as well as the fact that Curse is a rather expensive Charm, it's usually not preferred by players.
